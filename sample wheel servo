# This program demonstrates how to control a servo

# Import the relevant libraries
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
 
# GPIO Mode (BOARD / BCM)
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
 
# set GPIO Pins
ServoPinL = 7                                       # GPIO pin for the servo
ServoPinR = 12  
# set GPIO direction (IN / OUT)
GPIO.setup(ServoPinL, GPIO.OUT)                      # Set ServoPin's mode to output
GPIO.setup(ServoPinR, GPIO.OUT)  

# The servo is controlled using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
# The next few lines of code take care of the required setup for this functionality
# The details are not important; you should not modify this code
# --- Start of the PWM setup ---
    # Set PWM parameters
pwm_frequency = 50

    # Helper function to set the duty cycle

    # Create a PWM instance
pwm_servoL = GPIO.PWM(ServoPinL, pwm_frequency)
pwm_servoR = GPIO.PWM(ServoPinR, pwm_frequency)

# --- End of the PWM setup ---
